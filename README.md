2. Read our files in a global corpus
3. Remove arabic stop words
4. Stemmig using an arabic stemmer named Khoja
5. Calculate TF-IDF 
6. Get the cosinus similarity between our Query and each file
7. Sort files by the most recommended to user (the most similar to the Query) 
8. Note that we follow the same steps to prepare our query
